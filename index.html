<h3>The deliteful experience is based on <a href="delite.html">delite</a>, discover below what are the key 
	benefits to its architecture</h3> 

<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Leveraging Standards</h2>
</div>
<p>
	For maximum interoperability and faster learning curve, all our element architecture are built on top of the following
	Web Components standards:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/">Custom Elements</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-templates/">Templates</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/">Pointer Events</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/">ECMA402</a> JavaScript Internationalization</li>
	<li>ES5 <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.1.5">getter & setters</a></li>
	<li>ES6 <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe">Object.observe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	In particular, relying on custom elements makes deliteful UI elements fully interoperable with other custom elements including Polymer elements.
</p>

<div class="page-header">
		<h2>Multi Channel Architecture & Browsers Support</h2>
</div>	
<p>
	Our elements architecture has been thought to scale from the mobile devices to the powerful desktops. In particular
	we do provide cross-device theming based on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables">Bootstrap Less</a>
	variables as well as responsive layouts adapting to the various form factors.
</p>
<p>
	Deliteful elements have been thoroughly tested and are supported on the following platforms:
</p>
<ul>	
	<li>Windows IE9 and above</li>
	<li>Windows and MacOS Chrome, Firefox ESR 24+</li>
	<li>MacOS Safari 7 and above</li>
	<li>Android 4 and above, Stock & Chrome browsers</li>
	<li>iOS 6 and above, Safari & Chrome browsers</li>
	<li>WindowsPhone 8 IE 10</li>
</ul>
	
<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Seeking for Performance</h2>
</div>
<p>Delite and deliteful have been designed to balance functionality and adherence to standards with code size and 
	performance.</p> 
<p>A typical example of this trade-of strategy is that even if we do love the scoping principle behind 
	Shadow DOM scoping we are not ready to pay the price for it until this is natively implemented on all our supported
	platforms.</p>
<p>Another example would be the binding engine for our elements templates. This binding engine leverages
	<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a> syntax but is designed with code size and runtime
	performance in mind, providing just the feature set needed by most elements. For those with more advance needs
	in terms of binding our architecture is open enough to be able to leverage any other binding engine if required.
	You might want to checkout the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-js/liaison">liaison</a> project for alternate advanced data binding.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Consistent Approach to APIs</h2>
</div>
<p>We did our best to make sure all the elements we are providing are sharing a common approach to their APIs so
	you can get consistent experience across the various elements.</p>
<p>For example all our data-enabled elements such as list are sharing the same approach to connect to data leveraging the 
<a href="https://github.com/SitePen/dstore">dstore</a> project.</p>
<p>Similarly all our elements do automatically import their CSS styling in a similar manner using our theming aware CSS AMD loader.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Globalization and Accessibility</h2>
</div>
<p>
	Our elements are fully enabled for globalization, including string translations as well as bidirectional and 
	mirroring support. Bidirectional & mirroring code is optional to limit element code size and can be opt-in if needed.
</p>
<p>
	Deliteful elements are also designed and tested for accessibility including keyboard accessibility, zoom support and 
	screen reader accessibility through <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp">JAWS</a>
	and <a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/">iOS VoiceOver</a>.
</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Easy Toolchain</h2>
</div>
<p>
	Our toolchain leverages industry standards, starting with scaffolding your application with <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>, 
	customizing elements style using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a>, building it with <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>
	and loading it through <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> AMD loader.
</p>
<p>
	All our front end libraries are available as <a href="http://bower.io/search/?q=delite">Bower packages</a> and generators
	as <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=delite+deliteful">NPM packages</a>
</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2>Openness</h2>
</div>
<p>
	We are working in the open. Our all our code is available on Github under BSD license and we do welcome patch 
	contributions under the <a href="http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla">Dojo Foundation CLA</a>.
	Would you encounter a bug, need a missing feature or want to contribute feel free to enter issues or pull request
	on <a href="https://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful/issues?state=open">our issues list</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We also do value integration of our work in various other open source context, a good example being deliteful
	elements wrapped into <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> directives as part of 
	the <a href="https://github.com/tkrugg/angular-delite">angular-delite</a> project.
